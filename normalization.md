# Airbnb Database Normalization to 3NF

## üéØ Goal

The goal of this normalization process is to identify and remove data redundancies and anomalies in the Airbnb database design by applying the principles of database normalization, up to **Third Normal Form (3NF)**.

## üîç Step-by-Step Normalization

### ‚úÖ First Normal Form (1NF)

**1NF Requirements:**

- Atomic (indivisible) values
- Unique column names
- Unique rows

**Observations:**

- The original schema had atomic fields (no multi-valued or composite attributes), so it satisfies 1NF.

---

### ‚úÖ Second Normal Form (2NF)

**2NF Requirements:**

- Must be in 1NF
- No partial dependencies (i.e., no non-key attribute depends on part of a composite primary key)

**Observations:**

- All primary keys in the original schema are single-column UUIDs.
- There were **no partial dependencies**, so the schema satisfies 2NF.

---

### ‚ùå Third Normal Form (3NF)

**3NF Requirements:**

- Must be in 2NF
- No transitive dependencies (i.e., non-key attributes must not depend on other non-key attributes)

**Issues Identified and Resolved:**

### 1. Review Table Redundancy

- **Original:** `reviews` table contained both `user_id` and `property_id`.
- **Problem:** These can be inferred from `booking_id`, which already links the user and property.
- **Fix:** Replaced both `user_id` and `property_id` with `booking_id` to eliminate redundancy and ensure consistency.

### 2. Payment Flexibility

- **Original:** Payments linked 1-to-1 with bookings.
- **Problem:** If partial or multiple payments are allowed, this structure violates 1NF and introduces design rigidity.
- **Fix:** The `payments` table now allows multiple rows per `booking_id`, each with its `amount`, `payment_method`, and `payment_date`.

### 3. Property Pricing

- **Original:** `price_per_night` stored directly in the `properties` table.
- **Problem:** This violates 3NF if pricing changes over time, as multiple rows would require redundant data or override history.
- **Fix:** Extracted `price_per_night` into a new `property_prices` table with `valid_from` and optional `valid_to` dates.

## ‚úÖ Resulting Benefits

- Reduced **redundancy**
- Improved **data integrity**
- Easier to manage **historical pricing**
- Maintains **3NF compliance**
- Easier to extend and query

## üì¶ Tables Introduced or Modified

| Table              | Purpose                                         |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `reviews`          | References only `booking_id`                   |
| `payments`         | Allows multiple payments per booking           |
| `property_prices`  | Supports historical and dynamic pricing        |

## üìå Conclusion

The redesigned schema is now fully normalized to **Third Normal Form (3NF)**, ensuring data consistency, scalability, and maintainability in the Airbnb-like application.
